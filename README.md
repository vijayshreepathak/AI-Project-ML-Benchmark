# MNIST Digit Recognition: Multi-Algorithm Benchmark Analysis

Welcome to the **MNIST Digit Recognition** project!  
This benchmark study compares the performance of multiple machine learning algorithms on the classic MNIST handwritten digit dataset. The aim is to analyze **accuracy**, **training time**, and **prediction time**, highlighting trade-offs across various models.

---

## üß† Project Overview

Handwritten digit recognition is a key problem in computer vision and machine learning.  
The MNIST dataset, consisting of **70,000 grayscale images (28x28 pixels)** of handwritten digits (0‚Äì9), serves as an excellent benchmark for classification algorithms.

This project implements and compares:

- üîµ **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- üü† **PCA + KNN** (for dimensionality reduction)
- üü¢ **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** with linear kernel
- üî¥ **Random Forest Classifier**
- üü£ **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** (TensorFlow-based)

### üïí Training Time Comparison

| Algorithm      | Training Time (seconds) |
|----------------|--------------------------|
| **KNN**         | 52.57 s                  |
| PCA + KNN      | 0.00 s (no training needed) |
| SVM            | 124.70 s                 |
| Random Forest  | 24.34 s                  |
| CNN            | 45.55 s                  |

üìå *PCA+KNN* required zero training time. *SVM* was the slowest to train, while *Random Forest* and *CNN* offered faster model building.

## üìà Visualizations Included

* Digit distribution plots
* Accuracy vs. K-value (for KNN tuning)
* Accuracy, Training Time, and Prediction Time bar charts
* Confusion matrix for KNN
* Classification reports for KNN, SVM, and RF
* Misclassified sample visualizations
* CNN training accuracy and loss curves



## üîç KNN Confusion Matrix
The confusion matrix below shows the predictions made by the K-Nearest Neighbors classifier on the test set.


### Key Observations:
* Every digit from 0 to 9 has been perfectly predicted.

* No off-diagonal entries ‚Üí 100% classification accuracy on the given test data.

* This confirms KNN's strong performance on MNIST (though in practical deployment, such perfection is rare and may indicate       overfitting or a simplified test set)
